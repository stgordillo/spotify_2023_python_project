# Top Spotify Songs of 2023 - Python Project
## Introduction
Final project as a part of my Computer Programming II course. We were given the opportunity to choose whatever dataset we wanted.  I wanted to check out the most popular songs from a Spotify 2023 dataset. My plan was to take a look at which artists had the most songs in the list, what songs were the most streamed and finally play with one of the unique column categories in this particular dataset.

## Data Sources
The dataset used in this project was retrieved from a fairly popular Kaggle dataset found here: [Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023/data).
