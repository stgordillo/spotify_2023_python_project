![Amount of Songs for Top 10 Artists](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e955e055-6fe6-4caa-9b4f-b29308f98bcb)

The top 10 artists with the most songs in the Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2023 dataset.  Used value_counts() of the column artist(s)_name to obtain the data.
This is looking at the amount of songs that each artist has in the dataset.

This is a more straightforward look at the top 10 songs in the dataset measured by total amount of streams on Spotify.
I used both a bar chart and a pie chart to show the different ways to view the data and to also showcase my ability to create different kinds of charts with the same data. 

## Unique Song Attribute "Danceability"
![Danceability over Time](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d056442d-51f5-4c6a-8c73-8f8ad44b5465)

I compared the unique parameter "danceability" of songs to the year that the songs released in a line chart. This audio feature's definition is on their Spotify for Developers page as "Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity".
